# CoffeeMachine_Project
  * This is a REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) console app that simulates a coffee machine. The coffee machine has the ingredients to make coffee i.e., milk, water, and coffee beans. The coffee machine can hold infinite amounts of all the ingredients but initially contains nothing. The coffee machine also has a money box which stores all the money it collects through selling but initially, it is empty. There are different types of coffee that can be selected which have separate prices and amounts of ingredients required.
